Introduction to JavaScript
Fundamentals

- high level, object oriented multi-paradigm programming language.
- used to create dynamic effects in web development.
- frameworks - tools that make writing large scale applications easier.
- include react, angular, vue

- can be used to build both front-end (browser) and back-end systems
- can also be used to build mobile & desktop applications (ionic, react, )

- various versions - 2015 - ES6/ES2015 was a huge update. ECMA Scirpt. Modern JS is
everything after ES6.

- ES5 can be important 


******** Part 1 - section 8 - Values and variables

- value = piece of data
- use let variable_name = 'value_name' -- creates and declares a variable
- best practice is to use camelCase (second word capitalized)
- Restrictions: cannot start w/ a number + can only have number/letter/_/$
- use ALL uppercase for varibales that do not change (ex. PI)

- after declaring variable using 'let,' we do not need to use let to change value for var (mutability)

- use const for variables that do NOT change; must always set a variable (use by default)

- legacy method for defining variables; use var var_name = 'var_value'


******** Part 1 - section 9 - Data Types

- values are either objects ( let me = {name: 'Jones'}) or primitives (7 types).
1. Number - includes both integers or floating point
2. String - sequence of chracters
3. Boolean - true or false
4. Undefined - value taken by variable that is not yet defined (empty value) ex. let children;
5. NULL - also means empty value
6. Symbol (ES2016) - value that is unique and cannot be changed
7. BigInt (ES2020) - larger integers than Number type can hold

JS has DYNAMIC TYPING (similar to Python) - do not have to manually define data type when defining a var
Value has type, NOT variable

- use // to write comments

- use typeof to check data type
